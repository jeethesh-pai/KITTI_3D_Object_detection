This Repository explores KITTI Dataset to solve various self-driving cars tasks. 
The directories are created according to dimension associated with the task. 
```
For e.g., 
semantic segmentation of 2D images, can be found in KITTI_2D 
3D Object classification/visualization can be found in KITTI_3D directory
```

Currently, the repository is under progress and contains solutions of very few tasks.

The dataset for the Tasks can be found at [KITTI_website] and the related paper can be found at
[KITTI_Paper]
