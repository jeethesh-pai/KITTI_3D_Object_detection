# End to End Lane Detection

This repo is an unofficial implementation of the Paper 
![End to end Lane Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.00293.pdf) by Wouter Van Gansbeke et al. 
For the official Implementation and analysis, please visit their
![Github Lane Detection Official](https://github.com/wvangansbeke/LaneDetection_End2End) - Pytorch. 
I have taken a lot of inspiration from their repo as well as from 
![Lane Detection Unofficial Implementation](https://github.com/MaybeShewill-CV/lanenet-lane-detection) - Tensorflow 1.12 Version 
to complete my repository with Tensorflow 2.3 version. 

# Dataset Description

Curated dataset was downloaded from the ![Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UECiIOGjIua9ORIDfcZft8XGTQ-iTzuD)
of Wouter Van Gansbeke, which is a subset of 
![TuSimpe Lane Detection dataset](https://github.com/TuSimple/tusimple-benchmark/issues/3) with pre-processing. 
Given below is a sample visualization of the dataset
from Curated Dataset using ![sample_viewer.py](sample_viewer.py)
