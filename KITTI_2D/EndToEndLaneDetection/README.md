# End to End Lane Detection

This repo is an unofficial implementation of the Paper [End-to-end Lane Detection] by Wouter Van Gansbeke et al. 
For the official Implementation and analysis, please visit their [Github Lane Detection Official] - Pytorch. 
I have taken a lot of inspiration from their repo as well as from 
[Lane Detection Unofficial Implementation] - Tensorflow 1.12 Version 
to complete my repository with Tensorflow 2.3 version. 

# Dataset Description

Curated dataset was downloaded from the [Google Drive] of Wouter Van Gansbeke, which is a subset of 
[TuSimpe Lane Detection dataset] with pre-processing. Given below is a sample visualization of the dataset
from Curated Dataset.
